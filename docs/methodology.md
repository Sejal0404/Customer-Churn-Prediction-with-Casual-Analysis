# Customer Churn Analysis Methodology

## Overview
This document describes the methodology used for customer churn prediction and causal analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values in TotalCharges by converting to numeric and filling with 0
- Convert SeniorCitizen to categorical variable
- Map Churn target to binary (Yes->1, No->0)
- Remove customerID as it's not useful for modeling

### Feature Engineering
- Create tenure groups (0-1yr, 1-2yr, 2-4yr, 4+yr)
- Calculate charge ratios (MonthlyCharges/TotalCharges)
- Count total services used by each customer
- Handle categorical variables using one-hot encoding

### Feature Selection
- Use ANOVA F-test for initial feature selection
- Apply Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Random Forest
- Consider feature importance from multiple algorithms

## Model Training

### Algorithms Used
1. **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees with bagging
2. **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting with regularization
3. **LightGBM**: Gradient boosting framework optimized for speed

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use GridSearchCV with 5-fold cross-validation
- Optimize for ROC-AUC score
- Consider computational efficiency vs performance

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness
- **Precision**: True positives / (True positives + False positives)
- **Recall**: True positives / (True positives + False negatives)
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve

## Causal Analysis

### Methodology
- Use DoWhy framework for causal inference
- Apply propensity score matching for treatment effect estimation
- Validate results with refutation tests
- Consider common confounders like tenure and monthly charges

### Treatment Variables
- Contract type (Month-to-month vs Longer contracts)
- Payment method (Electronic check vs Automatic payments)
- Internet service type (DSL vs Fiber optic)

### Assumptions
- Ignorability: No unmeasured confounders
- Positivity: All treatment levels possible for all units
- Consistency: Well-defined treatments

## Model Interpretability

### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
- Calculate feature importance using game theory
- Provide both global and local explanations
- Handle feature interactions naturally

### Business Interpretation
- Translate model outputs to actionable insights
- Consider cost-benefit analysis for interventions
- Provide risk assessment for individual customers

## Validation Strategy

### Cross-Validation
- Use stratified k-fold cross-validation (k=5)
- Ensure representative sampling of churn cases
- Monitor for overfitting with train-test separation

### Business Validation
- Compare model predictions with business intuition
- Validate causal findings with domain experts
- Test policy recommendations with A/B testing where possible

## Limitations

### Data Limitations
- Historical data may not reflect current market conditions
- Limited features for customer behavior analysis
- Potential sampling biases in the dataset

### Model Limitations
- Correlation vs causation challenges
- Assumptions of causal analysis may not hold perfectly
- Model performance depends on data quality and relevance

## Future Improvements

### Technical Enhancements
- Incorporate time-series analysis for customer behavior
- Add natural language processing for customer feedback
- Implement reinforcement learning for retention strategies

### Business Enhancements
- Integrate with CRM systems for real-time predictions
- Develop personalized retention offers
- Create dashboard for business user interaction
